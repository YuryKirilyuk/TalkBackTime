            <li><u><span>Accounts and Credentials</span></u><span>. You must use an email address that is both active and actively monitored by you to create an account on or using the Services.

If you hold a “Super User” account on the Services, you have the ability to provision “Secondary User” accounts (which have their own separate login credentials) to access and use the Services on your behalf, you are fully responsible for all activities that occur through or using such Secondary User accounts as though they were your own, and the terms “you” and “your” herein shall be deemed to apply to you and any Secondary Users you provision. Accounts and passwords may not be shared and may only be used by one individual per account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for all activities that occur using your account or password, whether or not you authorized such activity. Note that if a Super User account is disabled or deleted, associated Secondary User accounts will also be disabled or deleted. </span></li>

            <li><u><span>Restricted Information</span></u><span>. If your use of the Services or Materials requires you to comply with industry-specific legal obligations and/or regulations applicable to such use, you will be solely responsible for such compliance, and you may not use the Services or Materials in a way that would subject us to those industry-specific regulations without obtaining our prior written agreement.

            <li><u><span>Review and Removal of Materials</span></u><span>.

            <li><u><span>Feedback</span></u><span>. If you provide us with feedback, reviews, or comments about the Services, such feedback does not constitute Materials, and subject our Privacy Notice, we may use that feedback for any purpose without any obligation to you. </span></li>

            <li><u><span>Taxes</span></u><span>. Except as provided herein or otherwise indicated, our prices and invoices do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature such as value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “<strong>Taxes</strong>”), and you are responsible for paying Taxes associated with your purchase.

            <li><u><span>By You</span></u><span>. You may terminate your use of the Services at any time through your account settings and/or by contacting us as provided at the end of this Agreement. Such termination will result in the deactivation or disabling of your account and access, and may result in the deletion of Materials you caused to be processed through the Services. If you terminate prepaid Services in the middle of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund unless you are terminating for any of the following reasons: (i) we have materially breached the Agreement and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after you have so notified us in writing; (ii) a refund is required by Law; or (iii) we, in our sole discretion, determine a refund is appropriate. By way of example, we will not grant a refund where you have used our Services, collected responses, and/or downloaded your responses unless the termination is due to our material, uncured breach or a refund is required by Law. </span></li>
            <li><u><span>By Us</span></u><span>. We may terminate your use of prepaid Services at the end of a billing cycle by providing at least 15 days’ prior written notice to you. We may terminate your use of the Services for any reason by providing at least 15 days’ written notice to you and will provide a pro rata refund for any period of time you did not use in that billing cycle. In addition to the foregoing, we may limit or suspend performance, or terminate your use, of the Services for any of the following reasons: </span>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>You have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after we have notified you in writing; </span></li>
                    <li><span>You fail to pay amounts due within 10 days after the due date;</span></li>
                    <li><span>You cease your business operations or become subject to insolvency proceedings and those proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days; </span></li>
                    <li><span>You fail to comply with any terms or conditions of this Agreement; </span></li>
                    <li><span>You use the Services in a way that we reasonably believe causes potential or actual: (1) disruption to the Services or others’ use of the Services; and/or (2) legal liability, harm, or security risk to us, our systems, our service providers, licensors, or third parties; or </span></li>
                    <li><span>We reasonably suspect and/or are investigating suspected misconduct by you. </span></li>
                </ol>

                <span>If we limit, suspend, or terminate the Services you receive, we will generally endeavor to give you advance notice. However, there may be situations where we may decide that we need to take immediate action without notice. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of any limitation or suspension under this Section as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action. We have no obligation to retain Materials beyond the time specified in the applicable Services description, subscription levels, or upon termination of the applicable Service. Please note that, in the event of repeated or material breach of this Agreement, we may take additional measures to prevent the breaching party’s further use of the Services, such as blocking an IP addresses. </span>

Any controversy or claim between us and you arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach thereof, including disputes with respect to arbitrability, authority of the arbitrator, and whether the subject matter of any controversy or claim is within the scope of this arbitration provision, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its choice of law rules and will be settled by binding arbitration in New Castle County, Delaware under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (for business customers) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) and administered by the AAA. The parties explicitly disclaim any applicability of the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods to this Agreement. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English. Such arbitration will have one (1) neutral arbitrator if the amount in controversy is less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) or otherwise before a panel of three (3) neutral arbitrators. Each of the arbitrators must be: (i) a lawyer licensed to practice law in the United States with a minimum of fifteen (15) years of legal practice or senior level business experience or a retired judge with a minimum of five (5) years of service on the bench; (ii) an individual with at least five (5) years of experience as an arbitrator; and (iii) on the roster of neutrals of the AAA or similar nationally recognized ADR organization. If the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted before a panel of three neutral arbitrators, the panel shall be selected using the following process: Within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of arbitration, TalkBackTime and you shall each select one person meeting the specified qualifications to act as neutral arbitrator, and the two thus selected shall select a third neutral arbitrator meeting the specified qualifications within fifteen (15) days of their appointment. The third neutral arbitrator shall act as the chair of the arbitration panel. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable to or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA. Notwithstanding this arbitration provision, we may seek emergency, temporary, or preliminary injunctive relief from a competent court of law or equity pending the final ruling of the arbitrator(s), without any requirement to post bond, to prevent irreparable harm arising from any unlawful acts by you. NEITHER YOU NOR TALKBACKTIME WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN AN ARBITRATION, EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, CLAIM OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREUNDER, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.</span></li>
