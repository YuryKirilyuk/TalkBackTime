    <li><h2><strong>4. Surveys and Submissions.</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><u><span>Submissions</span></u><span>. The Services provide a platform for Creators to make Surveys available to you, and to request and obtain Submissions from you. TalkBackTime has no responsibility or liability for the processing of Surveys or Submissions through the Services, nor for the content of such Surveys or Submissions.</span></li>
            <li><u><span>License to Surveys and Submissions</span></u><span>. By providing Submissions through the Services, you grant Creator a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and irrevocable license to use, process, reproduce, perform, display, publish, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, sell, license, sublicense (through multiple levels), broadcast, transmit, distribute, exhibit, disseminate or otherwise exploit through or by means of any media, formats or other means now known or developed in the future such Submissions. By providing Submissions through the Services, you grant TalkBackTime a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, and sublicenseable (through multiple levels) license to use and process the Submissions for the purpose of providing, developing, troubleshooting, and analyzing the use of, the Services. </span></li>
            <li><u><span>Processing of Submissions</span></u><span>. You are responsible for any and all Submissions you process or cause to be processed through the Services, and any such processing of Submissions is at your own risk. You represent, warrant, and covenant that: (i) the Submissions, and your provision thereof, comply with this Agreement, including the <a href="/acceptable-use-policy/">Acceptable Use Policy</a>; (ii) you have all rights in and to the Submissions necessary to grant the rights and licenses contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) neither the Submissions nor the use thereof in compliance with this Agreement will violate this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy), Law, or the rights of any party; (iv) the Submissions do not contain, constitute, or link to Malicious Code; and (v) you have obtained a valid release from all individual persons whose likenesses appear, and whose voices are heard, in the Submissions. </span></li>
            <li><u><span>Restricted Information</span></u><span>. If your use of the Services or Submissions requires you to comply with industry-specific legal obligations and/or regulations applicable to such use, you will be solely responsible for such compliance, and you may not use the Services or provide Submissions in a way that would subject the Creator or TalkBackTime to those industry-specific regulations. For example, you may not use the Services to process or Submit “protected health information,” as defined by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and its regulations. Similarly, you may not use the Services to collect, access, or process “nonpublic personal information” as defined by the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 and it’s implementing regulations, “cardholder data” or “sensitive authentication data” as defined by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or information protected by similar laws or obligations (collectively with protected health information, “<strong>Restricted Information</strong>”). In the event you use the Services to Submit Restricted Information in violation of this provision, contact the Creator immediately as described at the end of this EULA. </span></li>
            <li><u><span>Retention of Materials</span></u><span>. The Creator has control over whether and in what way it uses and retains Submissions obtained through the Services. Certain subscription models for the use of the Services may limit the size, amount, duration, or other characteristics of Surveys or Submissions processed, and/or the types and amounts of Submissions the Creator may collect or the period for which they are stored. To the extent permitted by Law, neither the Creator nor TalkBackTime will be liable for any failure to store, or for loss or corruption of, Submissions.</span></li>
            <li><u><span>Review and Removal of Materials</span></u><span>. You acknowledge and agree that the Creator and/or TalkBackTime may, but have no obligation to, review certain Submissions or Surveys made available through the Services, including in response to reports of unlawful or infringing Submissions or Surveys, or to evaluate compliance with this Agreement and/or the Acceptable Use Policy. The Creator may, or may be required to, remove, limit access to, modify, or refuse to display Submissions or Surveys that the Creator or TalkBackTime believe violate this Agreement and/or Law. If the Creator or TalkBackTime takes any of the foregoing actions with respect to any Submissions, do not re-submit such Submissions. </span></li>
            <li><u><span>Feedback</span></u><span>. If you provide the Creator or TalkBackTime with feedback, reviews, or comments about the Services or Surveys, such feedback does not constitute Submissions, and subject to the applicable Creator or TalkBackTime privacy policy/notice, the Creator and/or TalkBackTime may use that feedback for any purpose without any obligation to you. </span></li>

    <li><h2 id="section-9"><strong>9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution. </strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><u><span>Governing Law; Venue</span></u><span>. This Agreement is governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law. The Creator makes no representation that the Services or Surveys are applicable or appropriate for use in all locations. If you use the Services or Surveys from other locations, you are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. If you take legal action relating to this Agreement or your interactions with or relationship to the Creator, the Services, or TalkBackTime that is not subject to arbitration as provided below, you agree to file such action only in the state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware and waive any objection you may have to the venue or forum. </span></li>
            <li><u><span>Injunctive or Equitable Relief</span></u><span>. You acknowledge and agree that your actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm to Creator and/or TalkBackTime for which monetary damages would not constitute an adequate remedy and, in addition to any and all other rights that may be available in respect of such breach or threatened breach, will entitle the Creator and/or TalkBackTime to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without any requirement to post bond.</span></li>
            <li><u><span>Arbitration of Disputes; Class Action Waiver; Jury Trial Waiver</span></u><span>. Any controversy or claim between Creator and you arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach thereof, including disputes with respect to arbitrability, authority of the arbitrator, and whether the subject matter of any controversy or claim is within the scope of this arbitration provision, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its choice of law rules and will be settled by binding arbitration in New Castle County, Delaware under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (for business respondents, or the Consumer Arbitration Rules for individual respondents) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) and administered by the AAA. The parties explicitly disclaim any applicability of the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods to this Agreement. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English. Such arbitration will have one (1) neutral arbitrator if the amount in controversy is less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) or otherwise before a panel of three (3) neutral arbitrators. Each of the arbitrators must be: (i) a lawyer licensed to practice law in the United States with a minimum of fifteen (15) years of legal practice or senior level business experience or a retired judge with a minimum of five (5) years of service on the bench; (ii) an individual with at least five (5) years of experience as an arbitrator; and (iii) on the roster of neutrals of the AAA or similar nationally recognized ADR organization. If the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted before a panel of three neutral arbitrators, the panel shall be selected using the following process: Within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of arbitration, each party shall each select one person meeting the specified qualifications to act as neutral arbitrator, and the two thus selected shall select a third neutral arbitrator meeting the specified qualifications within fifteen (15) days of their appointment. The third neutral arbitrator shall act as the chair of the arbitration panel. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable to or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA. Notwithstanding this arbitration provision, the Creator and/or TalkBackTime may seek emergency, temporary, or preliminary injunctive relief from a competent court of law or equity pending the final ruling of the arbitrator(s), without any requirement to post bond, to prevent irreparable harm arising from any unlawful acts by you. NEITHER YOU NOR CREATOR NOR TALKBACKTIME WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN AN ARBITRATION, EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, CLAIM OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREUNDER, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.</span></li>
        </ol>
    </li>


    <li><h2><strong>10. Monitoring.</strong></h2><br />
        <span> TalkBackTime expressly reserves the right to monitor any and all use of the Services, Surveys, and Submissions, but have absolutely no obligation to do so, nor to continue to do so at any point. TalkBackTime also reserves the right to investigate and take legal action against any illegal and/or unauthorized use of the Services, Surveys, and/or Submissions and/or in response to any complaints or reports of abuse. </span></li>


    <li><h2><strong>11. Changes.</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><u><span>Changes to this Agreement</span></u><span>. This Agreement, including this EULA, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Privacy Policy, or other terms or disclosures applicable to use of some or all of the Services or Surveys may be changed or updated at any time for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes to Law, updates to Services, policies, licensors, or service providers, requirements from TalkBackTime, and/or additional or new functionality or Services, by posting such on the Services. Changes will be effective no sooner than the day they are publicly posted. Advance notice may be provided, or your consent may be required, for certain changes in order for them to become effective under Law. By continuing to use the Services after the effective date of such changes, you indicate your agreement to be bound by the updated terms.</span></li>
            <li><u><span>Changes to the Services</span></u><span>. The Services may add, modify, or remove functionality at any time with or without notice, and may be limited, suspended, or discontinued in whole or in part. </span></li>

            <li><u><span>Minors</span></u><span>. None of the Services are intended for use by minors (individuals under the age of 16, or higher as provided by Law). If you are a minor in your place of residence, you may not use the Services. If you provide Submissions that contain the personal data, the likeness, and/or the voice of a minor using the Services, in addition to the release required by Section 4(c)(v) with respect to such minor, you represent and warrant that you have appropriate parental and/or guardian consent to make such Submissions available through the Services and to grant the licenses to Submissions hereunder. </span></li>
            <li><u><span>Third-Party Websites</span></u><span>.

You should review any terms and conditions, privacy notices, and other terms associated with such third-party websites, applications, services, or materials before use.

No judgment or warranty is made with respect to the accuracy, timeliness, or suitability of the content of any website to which the Services may link, including information on such other website regarding us.</span></li>
            <li><u><span>International Use</span></u><span>. If you use or access the Services from locations outside of the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, you do so at your own risk, and you are responsible for compliance with any and all Laws.

            <li><u><span>Language</span></u><span>. All communications and notices made or given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in the English language. If a translation of the English language version of this Agreement is provided, the English language version of this Agreement will control if there is any conflict.</span></li>
            <li><u><span>Excusable Delay</span></u><span>. Neither Creator nor TalkBackTime will be liable to you for failure or delay in the performance of any terms and conditions hereof, when such failure or delay is due to causes beyond Creator’s or TalkBackTime’s reasonable control and without Creator’s or TalkBackTime’s fault or negligence, such causes including, but without being limited to, labor disputes; power failures; service interruptions; riots; civil unrest; terrorist or criminal actions; and/or government action.</span></li>
            <li><u><span>Assignment</span></u><span>. You may not assign this Agreement, and any assignment in violation of this provision shall be null and void. </span></li>
            <li><u><span>Independent Contractors</span></u><span>. Your relationship with Creator is strictly that of an independent contractor. No employer and employee relationship exists between the parties, either under common law or any statute. This Agreement does not create any actual or apparent agency, partnership or joint venture, franchise or other association between you and us. No party is authorized to enter into on behalf of or to commit the other to any agreements, and no party shall hold itself out as the agent or legal representative of the other.</span></li>
            <li><u><span>Miscellaneous</span></u><span>. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between you and Creator with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, or agreements, whether oral or written, between you and Creator with respect to such subject matter. If any part of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of remaining provisions. The decision not to pursue legal action for any violation of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any of Creator’s or TalkBackTime’s legal rights. Similarly, the failure by Creator or TalkBackTime to exercise or enforce any right or provision set forth herein shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</span></li>
